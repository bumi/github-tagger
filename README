Github Tagger
============

This is the backend for my Greasemonkey user script that adds tagging functions to the incredible awesome github.com.
It allows you to tag github repositories and search for tagged repositories. - all within github. 
The tags are saved on http://github-tagger.railslove.com.

I've hacked this script/app last night in a few hours visit http://github-tagger.railslove.com for more information.
